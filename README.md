- **Navigation Bar**: Instagram logo with action buttons
- **Story Tray**: Horizontal scrollable story items with user avatars
- **User Header**: Post author information with avatar
- **Post Content**: Main image with carousel indicators and tags
- **Post Info**: Like/comment/share buttons, post text, and comment input
- **Bottom Navigation**: Instagram-style tab bar
- **Home Indicator**: iOS-style home indicator

### 2. Profile Screen
- **Status Bar**: Dark theme with system information
- **Navigation Bar**: Back button, username with verified badge, action buttons
- **User Profile Data**: Avatar with story ring, stats (posts/followers/following)
- **Saved IG Stories**: Horizontal story tray
- **Promo Banner**: Shop now promotion banner
- **Tab Navigation**: Posts/Reels/Saved tabs
- **Grid Photo View**: 3-column photo grid with post type indicators
- **Bottom Navigation**: Instagram-style tab bar

- **Figma Integration**: Direct design-to-code implementation with real assets
- **Asset Integration**: Real images, icons, and avatars from Figma designs
- **Navigation**: Interactive navigation between Feed Post and Profile screens
- **State Management**: Proper state handling for screen transitions

### Design System
- **Colors**: Instagram-inspired color palette
- **Typography**: Consistent text styles and sizes
- **Spacing**: 8dp grid system
- **Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Assets**: Real images, icons, and avatars from Figma designs

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Kotlin Multiplatform project setup
- Compose Multiplatform dependencies
- Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Run the `composeApp` configuration
4. **Navigation**: Click on the avatar in the Feed Post screen to navigate to the Profile screen
5. **Back Navigation**: Click the back button in the Profile screen to return to Feed Post

### Build Configuration
The project uses Gradle with Kotlin DSL:
- **Target Platforms**: Android, iOS, Desktop
- **UI Framework**: Compose Multiplatform

- User interaction elements (like, comment, share)
- Comment input with emoji reactions
- Bottom navigation bar

### Profile Screen
- User profile with avatar and stats
- Story highlights section
- Photo grid with post type indicators
- Action buttons (Follow, Message, Subscribe)

## üîß MCP Tools Used

### Figma Integration
- **TalkToFigma**: Design analysis and asset extraction
- **FigmaDevMode**: Code generation and asset mapping with real assets
